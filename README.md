# NAAM House App (working title)
#Authors: Vincent Laquindanum
#Demo: https://expo.dev/@vincelaq/naam-house

## Introduction: 
This project was developed under the Esteem Hackathon "Equalithon". Equalithons are week-long, remote hackathons dedicated to addressing issues related to inequality in the workplace, as well as social and environmental challenges. 

For this Equalithon, we are supporting a nonprofit or a project by the community. It is an opportunity to address a critical societal challenge. 

My challenge, specifically, is to support NAAM House's mission that allows veterans with diabilities rangining from injuries and PTSD who are homeless find homes.

NAAM House, needs an app developed that responders/agencies can use to report to NAAM House of a veteran in need.

## What is objective?
This is app assists NAAM House in retrieving notifications when a responder or agency representative is dealing with a veteran that might be in need of assistance.


## How will it make a difference?
Instead of homeless veterans being booked in a jail cell for sleeping on public property, or being forwarded to the Veterans Affairs offices, NAAM House will receive of the notification from these departments of a veteran in need and NAAM House will assist the veteran. 

## The Design of the app
- It uses a simple design for responders to navigate.
- The data is simple using only one data model for the app form

## Technologies Used: 
Frontend: React Native
Frontend CLI: Expo
Backend: Node
Backend Frameworks: Express
Database: MySQL
SMS API: Vonage
Maps: Google Maps

## Future Enhancements: 
The equalithon might be over for this project, but I'm hoping to work with NAAM House more to get this app running for their uses.

- Deployment of the app on the App Store, Android, or web application.
- Implementing image upload for more information on veteran description and location
